        <h1>Unreal engine game development</h1>
        <nav>
          <ul>
Overview:
This project explores the Unreal game engine used by developers to design, build, simulate, and visualise games on major platforms like PlayStation, Nintendo, IOS, Steam, Xbox, and Oculus rift VR among many others. Specifically, the engine will be used to develop an arcade, simulation hybrid racing game on PlayStation with proper car physics, official licenses for car manufacturers and real tracks from across the globe, and one that offers new levels of realism and utilises virtual reality technology to enhance immersion.<br>
<p>
Motivation:
The project will be interesting to pursue because there’s currently a gap in the market for a racing hybrid of arcade and simulation. Presently, 2014 PS4 title Driveclub from developers Evolution Studios exists, but is pitched as more of an arcade title and has been criticised for its poor physics, “fictional predefined circuits” (Reilly,2014) and it’s range of just 50 selectable cars “is exclusively biased towards European manufacturers” (Reilly,2014). However, Driveclub’s developers, Evolution Studios shut down in March 2016, and so a second version of Driveclub never came. This sparked inspiration for this project as it will look to develop a worthy successor to the original Driveclub game.<br>

Description:
This game development project will draw most of its inspiration from Driveclub, which proved to be so successful at the time because it came early in the PS4’s life cycle, and was likewise praised for its “breathtaking visuals” (Reilly,2014) and “incredible sense of speed” (Reilly,2014). This project will follow a similar trajectory to that of Driveclub, however it will be developed in time for a simultaneous release alongside the PlayStation 5, which aims to be released by November 2020(Mochizuki,2019). This ensures that the project will be offered in the market as a sole representation of next generation racing games and thus has full market share for next generation racing games which ensures that sales will be high assuming the product is well received. This project will also aim to correct many of Driveclub’s criticisms, the largest being it missed the PS4 launch window by 12 months(Robinson,2016) and  was “riddled with errors that ranged from design oversights to servers that refused to stand up” (Robinson,2016). Additionally, this project will get official licences from the best and most well-known racetracks worldwide to insert into the game rather than just using tracks based on public roads from various global locations. However, to ensure that all aspects of the fanbase remain happy, and to keep the arcade vibes of the game ever-present, players can have the option of racing on the public tracks too. Moreover, the project will expand beyond just implementing European car manufacturers and will instead bring in companies from across the globe, it will also increase the number of available cars on launch day from 50 to at least 300. Something that will no doubt be challenging considering the amount of detail that goes into each car but is a necessary step as rival racing game title Gran Turismo also aims to release their new title alongside the PS5, thus making it a direct rival to this project. Gran Turismo 6 from 2013 was their most recent title and had a car list of 1197 cars (Robinson,2013) which far eclipses any figure Driveclub ever managed, but there was an evident lack of detail on each car as developers Polyphony Digital evidently opted for a quantity over quality approach. Hence, it’s pivotal that the number of cars in this project is at least triple the size of Driveclub’s initial range. Driveclub did eventually globalise their car range, however these new additions were implemented in the form of downloadable content which required players to pay real money for. The project will continue to add more cars throughout its lifecycle but will not charge players any additional money and will not implement any kind of season pass system. <br>

<p>
Tools and Technologies:
Hardware will include a PS5 when it’s released, Playstation camera, VR headset. Software will consist of two graphics Application programming interfaces, pixel shaders, Graphics processing unit,  Cairo, jQuery, Lua, Mono, OpenSSL, WebKit, and the Pixman rendering library(Phoronix,2014) , Software development kit. For the game itself, the cars in Driveclub run at 1080p at 30 frames per second had “an average of 260,000 polygons (Edge,2014). So it’s expected that this project could develop a game running at 8k resolution at 60 frames per second, and with more polygons per car.

<p>
Skills Required:
Developing this game will certainly be a challenge and will require sufficient knowledge of the Unreal game engine, in addition to a large number of workers, and may likely take over a year to complete. The Unreal engine 4 will likely be used, and it supports advanced DirectX 11 high-end rendering features and includes the Blueprint visual scripting tool, enabling developers to build content without writing a line of code. New animation system Persona is also built on top, helping developers refine the vehicle’s motion (MCV,2014)<br>
<P>
Outcome:
If this project, which is a Driveclub successor proves successful, does well in correcting flaws of the original game, and addresses community concerns like the significant launch delay, poor physics, bad servers, and limited range of vehicles which plagued Driveclub, and makes genuine efforts to correct any flaws that do emerge over the game’s lifetime, then this project will very likely be well received and can be said to be a success.<br>
