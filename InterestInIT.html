<p>
I've always been fascinated by the constant evolution of technology, and like others my age, have witnessed technological advancements throughout my lifetime and daily life as illustrated by mobile phones, computers, and televisions.<br>
<p>
I've been coming to RMIT open days since yr10 in high school and always liked what I saw. I ultimately chose to come to RMIT because I loved the campus facilities and its sense of vibrance. I also love it's open and airy surroundings, something most other uni's don't have as they're enclosed campuses. Having now done a semester, I love the teachers and I feel itâ€™s a brilliant and productive learning environment.
During my studies, I hope to learn all the various IT skills that will help strengthen my skillset heading into the workforce. At the completion of my studies, I hope that the combination of my 2 degrees, Logistics, and IT, in addition to the possibility of doing an MBA from a top business school, helps me get a viable future in the workforce which offers stability and a comfortable living.<br>
